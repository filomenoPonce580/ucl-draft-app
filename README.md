# UCL Draft App

An application for anyone who want to combine the excitement of Fantasy Football with the beautiful game of Soccer.

The rules of the game are simple. Each season will have anwhere between 2-8 participants, each participant will choose 4 teams, and those teams will gain the participant points if they win or draw during the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. At the end of the season there will be potentially two winners, the first being the player who's teams generate the most points. The second being the player with the team who ultimately wins the Champions League

## Selecting Your Teams

The team selection for each participant is similar to that of a fantasy football draft. The players will randomize the order in which they will choose their teams, and after the first round of choices the positions are inverted so it snakes back to the first player from round 1 at the end of round 2

Example:
`Round 1: Player 1 -> Player 2 -> Player 3 -> Player 4 -> Player 5 -> Player 6 -> Player 7 -> Player 8`
`Round 2: Player 8 -> Player 7 -> Player 6 -> Player 5 -> Player 4 -> Player 3 -> Player 2 -> Player 1`
`Round 3: Player 1 -> Player 2 -> Player 3 -> Player 4 -> Player 5 -> Player 6 -> Player 7 -> Player 8`
`Round 4: Player 8 -> Player 7 -> Player 6 -> Player 5 -> Player 4 -> Player 3 -> Player 2 -> Player 1`

## Group Stage Scoring Format

Points will be calculated in a way that rewards players for correctly choosing the underdog teams who perform well during the Champions League Campaign. 1 point will be awarded for a win, 0.5 points for a draw, and then will be accompanied by a mulpiplier based on what round the team was chosen.

Examples:  
`Manchester City is chosen in round 1 and draws: 0.5 x 1 = 0.5 points`  
`Real Sociedad is chosen in round 3 and draws: 0.5 x 3 = 1.5 points`  
`Celtic is chosen in round 4 and wins: 1 x 4 = 4 points`

This ensures an equal opportunity for all participants as the first few picks of the first round will usually have the highest likelyhood of winning the tournament, but the first few picks in the second/fourth rounds will provide the best opportunities to pick teams who can gain the most points in the group stage.
